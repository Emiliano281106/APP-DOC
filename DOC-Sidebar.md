## Code Explanation

### 1. **`export default function Sidebar() {`**
   - This declares a **functional component** called `Sidebar`.  
   - The component is exported as the default export from the file, making it available for use elsewhere in the application.

### 2. **`const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);`**
   - This line declares a **state variable** `open` using React's `useState` hook.  
   - Initially, `open` is set to `false`, meaning the sidebar will be closed when the component is first rendered.  
   - `setOpen` is a function that will be used to update the value of `open`.

### 3. **`const toggleDrawer = (newOpen) => () => { setOpen(newOpen); };`**
   - This is a **function to toggle the sidebar's open/closed state**.  
   - It accepts `newOpen`, which is a boolean value (`true` for open, `false` for closed).  
   - The returned function, when called, updates the `open` state using `setOpen`.

### 4. **`const menuItems = [ ... ];`**
   - This array contains the list of **menu items** for the sidebar.  
   - Each item is an object with three properties:
     - `text`: The text that will be displayed for the menu item (e.g., "Home", "Airports").
     - `icon`: The icon that will appear next to the text (e.g., `<HomeIcon />`, `<FlightTakeoffIcon />`).
     - `path`: The route path to navigate to when the item is clicked (e.g., `"/"` for Home).

### 5. **`const DrawerList = ( ... );`**
   - This defines the **JSX content** that will appear inside the sidebar (the `Drawer` component).  
   - It includes a `Box` component from Material UI, which wraps the entire content of the drawer with a width of `250px`.
   - **`List`**: Maps over the `menuItems` array and creates a clickable list item (`ListItem`) for each menu entry. Each item includes:
     - An icon (`ListItemIcon`).
     - The text (`ListItemText`).
     - A `ListItemButton` that links to the appropriate route using `react-router-dom`'s `Link` component.
   - **`Divider`**: Adds a visual separator below the list of items for styling.

### 6. **`return ( <div> ... </div> );`**
   - This is the **render output** of the component.

   - **Hamburger Icon:**
     - The `IconButton` component renders a hamburger icon (`MenuIcon`).  
     - When clicked, it calls `toggleDrawer(true)` to open the sidebar. The button is styled with `color="inherit"` and `edge="start"`, which are Material UI properties for appearance and positioning.

   - **Drawer Component:**
     - The `Drawer` component is a Material UI component used to create the sidebar.  
     - The `open` prop controls whether the drawer is visible or hidden based on the `open` state.  
     - When the drawer is closed, it triggers `toggleDrawer(false)` to update the `open` state.

   - **`{DrawerList}`:**
     - The `DrawerList` (defined earlier) is inserted into the `Drawer` as the content.  
     - This renders the list of clickable menu items inside the sidebar.
